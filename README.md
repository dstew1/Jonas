# Jonas
Jonas is a voice assistant I am currently developing using python. Jonas will be able to use a variety of API's in order to complete tasks such as computing math problems, create short sentence and paragraph predictions given a query, and search wikipedia. This project is still in very early stages, but feel free to follow along as I continue to make Jonas a more advanced and better assistant.
#
Version 1.0 of Jonas utilizes a few public Models that can easily be implemented into your code. 

For my next version of Jonas I plan to have implemented at least one model of my own, plus a few other additions hopefully!

PS. Jonas has to be able to run on my 8gb Raspberry Pi 4B

#
Current Version 2.0 goals: Automate Jonas so that Jonas is booted on startup of my Pi, ability to set reminders, new voice trained by me that is less robotic sounding, ability to launch tools given a query, and code organization fixes.
