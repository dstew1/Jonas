# Jonas
Jonas is a voice assistant I am currently developing using python. Jonas will be able to use a variety of API's in order to complete tasks such as computing math problems, create short sentences and paragraphs given a query, and search large databases like wikipedia. This project is still in very early stages, but feel free to follow along as I continue to make Jonas a more advanced and better assistant.
