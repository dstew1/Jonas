# Jonas
Jonas is a voice assistant I am currently developing using python. Jonas will be able to use a variety of API's in order to complete tasks such as computing math problems, create short sentences and paragraphs given a query, and search large databases like wikipedia. This project is still in very early stages, but feel free to follow along as I continue to make Jonas a more advanced and better assistant.

Version 1.0 of Jonas utilizes a few public Models that can easily be implemented into your code. 

For my next version of Jonas I plan to have implemented at least one model that I have trained myself using either a public dataset or one of my own making... plus a few other additions hopefully!

PS. Jonas has to be able to run on my 8gb Raspberry Pi 4B
